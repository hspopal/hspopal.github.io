## [fMRI Preprocessing at UMD](https://github.com/hspopal/tutorials/tree/main/neuroimaging/umd_preprocessing)
This is a practical tutorial that covers fMRI preprocessing using fmriprep. It was designed specifically for researchers at the University of Maryland, College Park to download their data from the Maryland Neuroimaging Center, convert the raw dicoms to NIFTIs, and then preprocess their structural and functional data on a remote high performance computing cluster. Paths and names can be changed to accomadate the resources available to your lab.  


## [Univariate neuroimaging analyses with nilearn](https://github.com/hspopal/tutorials/tree/main/neuroimaging/univariate_analyses)
This tutorial takes users through a first level (individual) analyses of fMRI data. The software used is Nilearn, a python based neuroimaging software. A notebook is also available as an example of how to complete second level (group) analyses using nilearn.
