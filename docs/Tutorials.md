# [fMRI Preprocessing at UMD](https://github.com/hspopal/tutorials/tree/main/neuroimaging/umd_preprocessing)
This is a practical tutorial that covers fMRI preprocessing using fmriprep. It was designed specifically for researchers at the University of Maryland, College Park to download their data from the Maryland Neuroimaging Center, convert the raw dicoms to NIFTIs, and then preprocess their structural and functional data on a remote high performance computing cluster. Paths and names can be changed to accomadate the resources available to your lab.  


# [Univariate neuroimaging analyses with nilearn](https://github.com/hspopal/tutorials/tree/main/neuroimaging/univariate_analyses)
This tutorial takes users through a first level (individual) analyses of fMRI data. The software used is Nilearn, a python based neuroimaging software. A notebook is also available as an example of how to complete second level (group) analyses using nilearn.



# Temple University Coding Outreach Group
While in graduate school, another graduate student and I started a [coding outreach group](https://tu-coding-outreach-group.github.io/). The goals of the group were to provide coding assitant to our colleagues, host advance coding skills workshops, and introductory coding tutorials. I have a strong belief that the best way to learning how to code, is to do actual coding. While there are many tutorials that show people coding principles and how to write code, these workshops take users through code. To complete these workshops, uses had to actual write and run code, as I and others helped them through. The idea was that once people got their hands dirty with some coding, it would overcome that initial hump of getting started. When they needed to use coding for their actual research, they will feel comfortable diving right in. Below are some of the workshops that I created and ran.

- [Intro to bash, python and R](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/intro-to-coding-2022)
- [Open Access Datasets](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2020/tree/master/open-access-datasets)
- [Representational Similarity Analysis](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2021/tree/main/rsa)
- [How to use linux servers](https://tu-coding-outreach-group.github.io/cog_summer_workshops_2021/linux-owlsnest/index.html)
