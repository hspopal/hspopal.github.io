# The Cerebellum's Role in Reward Processing
Models have been successfully developed to explain the role of the cerebellum in motor processing. These models emphasize the cerebellum’s role as a learning machine that modulates and perfects ongoing processing through the online comparison of reality to an internal model, thereby utilizing sensory prediction errors. Recent findings in humans and mice suggest that portions of the cerebellum are involved in reward processing; a process which has primarily been investigated in regards to the basal ganglia. It is unclear what computational role the cerebellum plays in this reward processing, as the cerebellum has been said to explicitly operate without reward information. To understand this, my dissertation will use fMRI in healthy young adults to study the cerebellum’s contribution to both traditional (e.g. monetary) and social reward processing, and to differentiate it from the role of the basal ganglia in reward processing.
