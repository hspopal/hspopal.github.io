# Social Relationship Knowledge

The overarching theme of my research career has been focusing on social knowledge, the semantic information we use to interact with others and to establish social norms and concepts. For example, spouses and siblings are two types of social relationships, where our knowledge about these relationships tells us the "rules" or typical actions of people in these different relationships. We can refer to this type of social knowledge as social relationship knowledge. When we interact with other people, we make inferences about them, and act accordingly based in part on our social relationship to them. While you can have love towards your sibling and your spouse, our social relationship knowledge of these relationships tells us that these relationships are different in other aspects (e.g. intimacy). If you have seen the first episode of Game of Thrones, your social relationship knowledge allowed you to process the last scene in that episode to set off alarms that something is wrong here.



# Social Cognition and the Cerebellum

The cerebellum has long been thought to solely process motor information. Yet, there is a growing literature that points to a role of the cerebellum in processes across multiple domains. Individuals with cerebellar lesions classically have motor deficits but, in some instances, also have problems with executive functioning, emotion processing, language, and social cognition. Multiple psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), have been linked to structural and functional differences in the cerebellum. Moreover, numerous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported neural responses in the cerebellum related to a host of non-motor tasks. These findings provide evidence that the cerebellum is involved in non-motor tasks, but it remains entirely unclear how the cerebellum contributes to performance on these tasks. 

Models have been successfully developed to explain the role of the cerebellum in motor processing. These models emphasize the cerebellum’s role as a learning machine that modulates and perfects ongoing processing through the online comparison of reality to an internal model, thereby utilizing sensory prediction errors. Recent findings in humans and mice suggest that portions of the cerebellum are involved in reward processing; a process which has primarily been investigated in regards to the basal ganglia. It is unclear what computational role the cerebellum plays in this reward processing, as the cerebellum has been said to explicitly operate without reward information. To understand this, my dissertation will use fMRI in healthy young adults to study the cerebellum’s contribution to both traditional (e.g. monetary) and social reward processing, and to differentiate it from the role of the basal ganglia in reward processing. 

Individuals with ASD exhibit deficits in social cognition and in social reward processing. Structural, functional, and connectivity differences have implicated the cerebellum in this disorder, with neonatal cerebellar damage being the second highest predictor of ASD. In my post-doc I hope to investigate how the cerebellum performs in individuals with autism, who have deficits in social reward processing. The training plan in this phase of the proposal will focus on learning computational modeling of reinforcement learning and applying these models to cerebellum functioning with fMRI.
