# Social Relationship Knowledge

When we interact with other people, we make inferences about them, and act accordingly based in part on our social relationship to them. Key older work on social relationships in social psychology and sociology explored the semantic space of social relational concepts and hypothesized that these concepts are represented dimensionally and categoricall. However, these studies failed to reach agreement on the organizing dimensions of human relationships and no attempt was made to understand the neural foundations. The goal of this study was to understand the representational architecture of social relationship knowledge. We hypothesized that our concepts of social relationships are organized along multi-dimensional components, with categories embedded in the dimensional space.

## The Dimensional Representation
We conducted a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk in which participants were asked to rate 159 social relationships on 30 dimensions derived from theories from the literature on social relationships. Next, we conducted Principal Component Analysis to find the overarching components that could account for the variance in social relationships. We found that five components â€“ formality, activeness, valence, exchange, and equality - accounted for most of the variance in the dimensional ratings of social relationships.
